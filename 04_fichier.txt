Not not today! Not not today!
Hey crow-tits, everyone, hands up
Hey friends, hands up
Hey, if you trust me, hands up
Point, aim, shoot!

We won’t die, don’t ask
Scream, not not today
Don’t kneel, we won’t cry
Hands up, not not today
Hey not not today
Hey not not today
Hey not not today
Point, aim, shoot!
